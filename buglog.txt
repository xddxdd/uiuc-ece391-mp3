Checkpoint 1:

- Problem:  Interrupt handling will cause General Protection Exception
  Cause:    Didn't set size bit of IDT entry
  Fix:      set it

- Problem:  System triple faults when enabling paging
  Cause:    The sequence of page table entry is reversed
            (using big-endian instead of little-endian)
  Fix:      Use little-endian

Checkpoint 2:

- Problem:  Random Double Fault at system bootup
  Cause:    When implementing cursor moving in printf,
            CLI/STI is used, which enables interrupts before
            i8259 is set up
  Fix:      Set up i8259 first at system bootup

Checkpoint 3:

- Problem:  Exiting from root shell twice causes page fault
  Cause:    The restarted shell is put at wrong memory location
  Fix:      Correct the location of the shell

Checkpoint 5:

- Problem:  Switching between terminals causes page fault on very low mem position
  Cause:    ESP & EBP was saved in a subroutine, but when restoring them, the extra layer
            wasn't accounted for
  Fix:      Move ESP & EBP saving code to main routine of execute / interrupt

- Problem:  Some texts are printed to the wrong terminal (different from the terminal the
            program is running)
  Cause:    The terminals aren't properly separated from each other (saving states during
            context switching isn't enough)
  Fix:      Rewrote terminal code and printing code, make sure they print to the correct terminal

- Problem:  Screen cursor sometimes isn't synced when terminal switches
  Cause:    Terminal cursor moving code checks if the displayed terminal is the same as running terminal,
            if they aren't then it does nothing
  Fix:      During terminal switching, temporarily "mask" running terminal to let it work

- Problem:  FISH is not correctly displayed on terminal #2 and #3, the bottom half is black, until we
            press enter to reach that line
  Cause:    Terminal #2 & #3 is initialized with all zero, which marks "black text on black background",
            and when pressing enter to that line, clear_row() fixes the attributes
  Fix:      Let initialization code initialize attributes correctly

Extra functionality:

- Problem:  Not receiving serial port interrupts
  Cause:    Sample code on OSDev.org didn't enable interrupts of serial controller,
            while it claims it does
  Fix:      Add the code that enables it

- Problem:  When a second program opens sound card, the first program using it will stop, reporting error
  Cause:    Opening for a second time incorrectly resets the "initialized" flag, marking sound card as
            uninitialized
  Fix:      Rewrote the code that detects whether sound card is in use
