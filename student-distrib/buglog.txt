Checkpoint 1:

- Problem:  Interrupt handling will cause General Protection Exception
  Cause:    Didn't set size bit of IDT entry
  Fix:      set it

- Problem:  System triple faults when enabling paging
  Cause:    The sequence of page table entry is reversed
            (using big-endian instead of little-endian)
  Fix:      Use little-endian

Checkpoint 2:

- Problem:  Random Double Fault at system bootup
  Cause:    When implementing cursor moving in printf,
            CLI/STI is used, which enables interrupts before
            i8259 is set up
  Fix:      Set up i8259 first at system bootup

Checkpoint 3:

- Problem:  Exiting from root shell twice causes page fault
  Cause:    The restarted shell is put at wrong memory location
  Fix:      Correct the location of the shell

Extra functionality:

- Problem:  Not receiving serial port interrupts
  Cause:    Sample code on OSDev.org didn't enable interrupts of serial controller,
            while it claims it does
  Fix:      Add the code that enables it
